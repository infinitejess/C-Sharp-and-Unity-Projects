# C-Sharp-and-Unity-Projects

This includes the C# fundamental concept assignments as well as a few projects created in Unity. The first project was small replica of the solar system with animated rotating planets that I created, scripted and added texture to. I also made a small maze game and a basic avoid the lava game that showed win/lose condtions and loaded the start of the game to retry.
